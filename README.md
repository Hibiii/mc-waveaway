# WaveAway

Wave at players or point at blocks without punching them, in a choco-lite way.
Alternatively, you can look at some empty space and right click to wave your off-hand.

To install, you need **[Fabric][1]** and **[FabricApi][2]**. There are no plans for a Forge version, backports, etc. To configure, keybinds are under "Multiplayer" in the controls screen. By default, WaveAway uses F7 for waving with the **main** hand and F6 for waving with the **off** hand.

## FAQ

**Is this compatible with vanilla servers?** \
Yes! This mod uses a *feature* in the vanilla multiplayer protocol. Spigot, Paper, Bukkit, etc. are thus *assumed* to support it, they likely do.

**Is this some cheat?** \
No, this mod uses the animation packet, the one used when dropping items or using (right clicking) signs.

**Make this mod for Forge!** \
That's not a question.

**Make this mod for Forge?** \
You're invited to do so.
